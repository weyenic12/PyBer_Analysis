# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
- The goal of this analysis is to use the data given in the CSV files regarding PyBer's ride-sharing data. We created a DataFrame of the data by different location types: Urban, Suburban and Rural. We then made a line graph representing the total weekly fares for each location type. The goal was to find the differences in those location types and what can be learned from the data from the perspective of PyBer.

## Results
- By looking at the code, you can see that there is a clear trend on the population of an area and the amount of total rides, drivers and fares there are. Urban areas have the most rides with 1,625 and rural has the least with 125. However the trend changes when referring to average fare per ride and average fare per driver. It is a much higher amount for the average fare per driver in rural areas at $55.49 and only $16.57 in urban areas. This price difference can be understanded by the longer drives in rural areas and less drivers in rural areas versus urban, therefore driving up the price.
- By looking at the line graph, you can see that we analyzed the Total Fares in USD and combined it with the month of the year(2019). You can see that all 3 locations about peaked in the third quarter of February. Urban continued an up and down pattern and steadied out in April. Suburban had a dropoff in March and didn't increase significantly until April. Finally, rural was steady over the course of the four months and ended up about where it started.
--------------------------
## Summary
- One business recommendation that we see would be allocating more drivers to rural areas as the average fare per driver is much higher than urban while the average fare per ride is relatively closer.
- Another recommendation is to find out why all three locations had a spike in Total Fares towards the end of February. Perhaps the answer to that information could help us in the future.
- One last recommendation for the company is reducing the amount of drivers in urban areas. There are almost 800 more drivers than rides and is the only location with more drivers than rides. Reducing the amount of drivers or relocating them to other areas could not only save money, but make it as well.
